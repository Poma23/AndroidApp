    <string name="optagelseDk">Applications to undergradute higher education in Denmark
        are assessed locally at the institutions but coordinated centrally in The Coordinated
        Admission. Consequently prospective students do not apply directly to any single
        educational institution, but through the national admission website:
        www.optagelse.dk \n The Ministry of higher education in Denmark lines up the rules
        for applying to a Danish Education with a foreign exam. However, it is the individual
        educational institution that evaluates your application and assesses whether you meet
        the entry requirements. Optagelse.dk is where you build your digital applications and
        attach documents for assessment by the institutions to which you wish to apply.</string>

    <string name="cpr">How do I get a Danish ID-number? (CPR)</string>
    <string name="vss">"To obtain your personal ID-number as an international student in Denmark you will need to register with the Danish Civil Registration System to obtain your personal ID number ('CPR number') while studying in Denmark.  Once registered you will be allocated a Civil Personal Registration (CPR) number. The CPR number is unique to the person and is used in Denmark as an ID number.  Almost all public authorities use the CPR registry system to e.g. avoid duplicate registration and errors with regards to a person's identity. "</string>

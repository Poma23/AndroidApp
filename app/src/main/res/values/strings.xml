    <string name="optagelseDk">Applications to undergradute higher education in Denmark
        are assessed locally at the institutions but coordinated centrally in The Coordinated
        Admission. Consequently prospective students do not apply directly to any single
        educational institution, but through the national admission website:
        www.optagelse.dk \n The Ministry of higher education in Denmark lines up the rules
        for applying to a Danish Education with a foreign exam. However, it is the individual
        educational institution that evaluates your application and assesses whether you meet
        the entry requirements. Optagelse.dk is where you build your digital applications and
        attach documents for assessment by the institutions to which you wish to apply.</string>
